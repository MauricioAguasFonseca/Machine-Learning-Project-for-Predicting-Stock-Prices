# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Return Prediction with News Sentiment

This project explores whether incorporating **news sentiment** can improve the prediction of next-day stock returns for major technology companies in the NASDAQ.  

We combine:
- Historical price data (OHLCV).
- Market news headlines (sentiment analysis with VADER).
- Feature engineering from both structured (prices, volumes, technical indicators) and unstructured data (text).

The workflow covers **EDA â†’ Feature Engineering â†’ Model Development â†’ Trading Strategy Backtest â†’ Reporting**.
